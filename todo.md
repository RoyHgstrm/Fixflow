## 🔧 Fixes

- [x] 🐛 Fix `CustomerStatsOverview` component to handle undefined stats
  - Updated prop name from `safeStats` to `stats`
  - Added null/undefined checks for all stat properties
  - Created `renderGrowthValue` helper function to handle different growth types
  - Prevents "Cannot read properties of undefined" error
- [x] 🐛 Fix `DashboardClientLayout` component import and prop type issues
  - Added optional `session` prop to handle server-side and client-side session
  - Updated sidebar component props to match their expected types

  - Updated component prop types to match expected interfaces
  - Added type safety for customer and stats data
  - Improved error handling and default values
  - Removed redundant prop passing
- [x] ✅ Fix `cookies()` should be awaited error
  - Wrapped `createServerComponentClient` with `cache` and explicitly captured `cookies()` result in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`.
  - Ensures `cookies()` is handled correctly in server components.
- [x] ✅ Fix `getSession` undefined error
  - Added `await` keyword before `createClient()` calls in `src/server/auth/index.ts`.
  - Removed unused `cookies` import from `src/server/auth/index.ts`.
- [x] ✅ Refactor `src/server/auth/index.ts` for NextAuth.js session management
  - Replaced direct Supabase client calls with `getServerSession` for session retrieval.
  - Removed the `signOut` function, as NextAuth.js handles logout.
- [x] ✅ Reverted `src/server/auth/index.ts` to use direct Supabase authentication
  - Replaced `getServerSession` with direct calls to `supabase.auth.getSession()` and `supabase.auth.getUser()`.
  - Ensured compatibility with existing NextAuth.js session type for components.
