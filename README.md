*   Docker (for local PostgreSQL and Supabase setup)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fixflow-app
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example`. You will need to configure your Supabase URL and Anon Key, and a database connection string.

```
# .env.example
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

```

### 3. Database Setup (with Docker)

Start your local PostgreSQL database and Supabase services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Run Prisma migrations to set up your database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 5. Generate Secret (if needed)

If you need to generate a new secret for your application (e.g., for JWTs), you can use the provided script:

```bash
npm run generate:secret
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üß™ Running Tests

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

```bash
npm test
# or for coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

```bash
npx playwright test
```

## üßπ Linting and Type Checking

To ensure code quality and type safety:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.
